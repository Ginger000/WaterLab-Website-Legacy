          Rebuilding urban infrastructure for rainwater design and management means targeting the urban streets. Chicago’s streets are engineered as the primary tributaries to the existing grey infrastructure system, with curbs and inlets as the primary collection and drainage points from paved surfaces. When Chicago has a rainstorm over 2/3", the water that drains into the underground infrastructure, overwhelms the combined-sewer system, and creates overflows of untreated sewage into the rivers. 
          <br><br>
          By rethinking this old system, the complex and ubiquitous network of streets throughout the City become a terrific place to target systemic green/blue infrastructure. By redesigning our streets to slow and capture rainwater, we can keep water OUT of the underground system. Water Lab has been investigating a series of surface-based block-wide approaches that keep water of the street pipes. 
          <br><br>
          An example of a potential water infiltration corridor is Stony Island Avenue running north-south in the 8th ward of Chicago. The site is replete with pavement and sandy soils exist beneath the paved surfaces. An inventory of the impervious spaces that drain water into the underground pipe infrastructure is accompanied by a proposed conversion of impervious spaces to permeable pavements and infiltration/bioretention gardens where driving and parking are no longer needed. By hydrologically activating surfaces—the median, parking lots, and the street surface itself—the street and surrounding spaces become sponges and filters for water, rather than draining this water into the underground pipe system.
          <br><br>
          This approach is described in <a href="https://shop.georg-media.de/topos-111/"> RETROFITTING URBAN LANDSCAPES (MCGUIRE, TOPOS INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE, 2020)</a>

        Two projects profiled— <a href="design_1_Midlothian.html">Village of Midlothian</a>  and <a href="design_0_Calumet.html">Calumet Cit</a> y—demonstrate further how streets can be re-designed for rainwater.
