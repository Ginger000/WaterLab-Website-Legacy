            <p class="announcement">Water Lab provides a forum to engage people living with and working on water issues. Through public events, talks, site installations, and exhibitions, we can better communicate with each other and exchange ideas. Multiple viewpoints, vocabularies, and voices at the collective 'water table' create a more meaningful and effective instrument for responding to water and stormwater issues in the region. 
              <br><br>
              In late Fall 2021, we will begin hosting events, talks, and workshops on water in Chicago and the Great Lakes.</p>

                  In Spring 2017, McGuire’s students explored asphalt through the lens of urbanism, new materialism, ecology, and aesthetics. They used the techniques of mental maps, dérive journeys, and experimental and conceptual representation techniques of layering (strata of data and systems), rhizome (endless connections and networks), and gameboard (shared surfaces of competing objectives) (from James Corner’s “Agency of Mapping”) - to produce new interpretations and organizations of a material that dominates our everyday life, but that rarely is questioned. Below they offer a series of quotes from select readings. Their design research culminated in an exhibition, in which they engaged visitors to play an Asphalt Game-Board. Questions were put forth to the players - and playing pieces (offering material alternatives) were used to reconfigure and transform the site (in this game, the Arts Quad of the South Campus.)
