                        LA437 regional design studio focuses on landscape-scale systems (geological, ecological, urban, social, infrastructural) to inform the future planning and design of regions. In order to project a future for a region, regional design requires an understanding of landscape systems as historical, dynamic, and multi-scale as well as to consider the often entangled relationships among these systems.The course aims to understand these scales and systems, and to give you a fundamental understanding from which to participate in design decision-making as a landscape architect. There are many professions and communities that both participate in and are subject to decision-making at a regional scale that impact local communities and landscape systems. We will learn about the multiple organizations, agencies, and voices involved in large-scale planning and design, and explore how landscape architecture is a key contributor to regional design visioning and decision-making.
                        <br><br>
In Fall 2020, we  will undertake this learning within the coastal region of the Chicago-Calumet. The Chicago-Calumet region is a low-lying area, located south of the Chicago Loop and extending into northern Indiana. Across this region, we will examine systems of water, land, and people, and the relationships among them. We will explore histories of infrastructure, urban-industrialization, and community development leading to today’s conditions and the design challenges that exist. Your observations, studies, and new understanding of the Chicago-Calumet coastal region will lead you to make design recommendations to increase equity and access for people to land and water.

                        The Depave Workshop series focuses on the physical, material conditions of urban ground surfaces as surfaces play a defining role in the ecological, social, and aesthetic performance of sites, cities, regions, and the planet. For landscape architects, attention to the medium of the ground, also understood as a surface, is essential to our practice. Our design field has the potential to design landscape through this essential medium with great local, regional, and planetary consequence. 
                        <br><br>
                        In Spring 2020 the workshop will focus on the under-explored urban surface of pavement by working with public space sites in Chinatown in Chicago. The workshop will begin with a seminar-style exploration of surface and materiality drawing from various disciplines, including conducting case studies of designed surfaces within landscape architecture. Building from these studies, your design process will consider the transformation of paved sites toward potentially radical alternatives to material selection, composition, and organization of urban ground surface. Considering that 25% of Chicago is surfaced with asphalt alone, the workshop will learn from the generalizable, yet specific, conditions of Chicago. The final project will explore the transformation of district-wide urban surface.

                        This workshop was part of a two-year funded research project, sponsored by Illinois/Indiana Sea Grant under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s coastal communities program. The studio design addressed urban flooding in the ‘Calumet Corridor’ region, and focused on two select municipalities directly. The workshop was composed of many phases and collaborates with geologists, engineers, and communities in an unfolding process. 
                        <br><br>
                        The studio(<a href="design_0_Calumet.html"> Calumet</a>,<a href="design_1_Midlothian.html"> Midlothian</a>) considers how geologic soil material and the modeling of its rainwater performance can return functionality to the land in the project site. Native sub-soils have been ignored as a viable material for resolving urban flooding in the region. We are working to rebuild an understanding of soils as an essential material in urban (wet) resilience. Design, itself, is a central method for conceptualizing new relations among these systems; meaning that, beyond restoring functionality of those soils, the role of design here is to redesign the relationship of our culture with land. Beyond positivist, rational “problem-solving” of “issues” like urban flooding, design seeks new alternative visions and responses through a new social ecology. 
                        <br><br>
                        In the workshop, landscape architecture will be an agent of design and creativity to move beyond typical green infrastructure. Design and design thinking processes will uncover a vocabulary and framework for creating intentional sites and spaces for water with the Calumet communities.
                        <br><br>
                        Two primary questions we consistently be explored in this workshop:
                        <br><br>
                        1. What are the patterns and processes of wet landscape that want to be revealed through conscious design?
                        <br>
                        2. How can we introduce a rain terrain approach that integrates multiple voices and knowledge for the Calumet?

                        The Spring 2018 Surface Workshop will focus on the performance of cities by looking at the ground surface of sites, from the scale of a lot to a block, to the region and arguably to the planet. Surfaces mediate our environment (think of black-top and urban heat island effect). They also generate aesthetic, phenomenal and haptic experiences with that environment (think of walking across that same blacktop in summer). Surface determines the world around us. We create surfaces, and surfaces create us.
                        <br><br>
                        Within this broad context, our workshop will focus on the design medium of two urban surface types: urban pavement and abandoned, vacant land. As landscape architects (and urbanists) we raise challenges to these surface environments, and we envision alternative futures for these sites. But to what? American cities consist of 50-80% imperviousness, with about half of that quantity consisting of pavement and compacted soil. Your research and design work will investigate this issue, and will culminate in reasoned but potentially radical alternatives to these urban surfaces. We will explore how landscape architecture as a topographic, material, and performance art can address this issue through design.
                        <br><br>
                        Our workshop will begin by defining surface, through an exploration of materiality in design culture, coupled with understanding ecological and aesthetic performance of surfaces within landscape architecture specifically. Building from these studies, your design process will consider retrofit conversions of paved and vacant sites, away from normative uses of standardized materials, toward design of multi-functional, multi-sensory and living-systems surfaces.

                        While surface is the central design inquiry of the ReThinking A Lot Surface seminar, we will focus our new
                        understanding of surface on the under-explored design issue of parking lots--a monolithic, infrastructural, and dominant pavement surface. Your design work will culminate in researched, and potentially radical alternatives, to material selection, composition, and organization of pavement systems and of parking lots. While our inquiry will initially address pavement in different contexts, we will apply our learning to our campus, and by end of semester we will redesign one pavement parking surface. The seminar and the final project will situate landscape architecture as a material art, a topographic art, an ecological practice, and a social practice, all of urban-ecological consequence. We will take a ‘layered’ approach, understanding surface as a materiality and composition/configuration alike, in four dimensions: horizontally both directions, vertically, and over time. And we will learn about surface from multiple disciplinary texts and perspectives. Building from these research studies, your design process will consider retrofit conversions of paved sites, away from normative uses of standardized, off-the-shelf materials, toward design of multifunctional, multi-sensory living systems surfaces.

                        Overall, this course aims for you to become aware and to question material practices in landscape architecture. My hope and intention is not to introduce you to ‘best practices’ but to raise questions for your work, and to give you some tools for doing so through your future practice.

                        This experimental design workshop will explore innovative practices in landscape surface design, and students will propose new surface configurations based on an agenda for evolving material agency.
                        There are two fundamental intentions/drivers of the workshop experiment. The first is that within the context of a highly paved planet, students will consider landscape surface materials, compositions, and organizations beyond a single-state/single-function toward multi-functional, multi-sensory, living systems surfaces. The second is to provide a workshop through which students may operate/act as agents in the medium and practice of landscape architecture. Students will explore (new) potentials within landscape materials, compositions, surface, form, use, experience, and performance (and to test the perceived boundaries of these). Students will deepen their skills and design thinking that can lead to increasingly powerful/effect-ive shifts in their design practice and built work.
