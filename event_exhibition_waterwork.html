                        The exhibition profiled five ‘visual essays’ by eight artists and designers that investigate flows, processes, infrastructures, narratives, and indexes of the past, present, and future of fresh water. Artists’ and designers’ methods and mediums involve oil, graphite, watercolor, photography, mapping, film, sound, and archival research. 
                        <br><br>
                        Both media and mediums are variously explored to reveal physical, material, and temporal relationships with water ways, water infrastructure, water-based production sites, water resources, as well as the qualities, textures, spatialities, and sensations of water.

                        ON THE POND: Catfish Farming in the Delta 
                        <br><br>
    by Forbes Lipschitz and Justine Holzman
                        <br><br>
    On the Pond: Catfish Farming in the Delta represents the context and ecology of catfish farming in the Deep South through illustrative, informative, and regionally specific landscape representations. Catfish farms are located principally in the Delta, an arc of alluvial bottomland bounded by the Yazoo and Mississippi Rivers that has been labeled by many as “the most southern place on earth.” Home to some of the richest agricultural land in the United States, the Delta is also an important ecoregion for migrating and wintering waterfowl along the Mississippi Flyway. As historic wetlands continue to diminish, catfish farming offers the opportunity for both habitat creation and sustainable aquaculture production. Inspired by local landscape painters, historical research, and field studies On the Pond utilizes a combination of photography, mapping practices, and digital drawing, to convey the landscape of catfish farming in the Delta.

                        WHEN THE ONLY WATER LEFT IS GRAY
                        <br>
from the place of production to the place of consumption
<br><br>
by Thomas Nideroest
<br><br>
Continuous economic and population growth challenge our fresh water resources globally. Particularly governments of arid and water stressed regions are pressured to sustain future growth projections. As a result, arid megacities set out on a quest to increase their water portfolio by expanding their water-energy-network, heavily relying on hydroengineering. State funded megaprojects provide the technical means to tap into water abundant inland territories, that lay for beyond the city’s jurisdictional borders and bridge vast geographies. Today, the centralized systems that artificially altered the flow of rivers and streams to convey water from water rich to deficit regions, are experiencing structural and environmental limitations.
<br><br>
When the only water left is gray, is the title to a larger design research project under the Harvard based Charles Eliot Traveling Fellowship. This comparative project studies the effects of drought in arid regions and discusses issues of water scarcity by documenting their territorial water system. The images on display showcase how water is artificially moved towards Los Angeles. Each image portraits a critical water infrastructure, in isolation to its territorial system, moving from East to West. In this layout, the precise arrangement along a linear horizon line stresses the artificiality of this water flow and establishes the city of Los Angeles as the main gravitational force. Furthermore, the de-composition of the territorial water system contextualizes the marginalized landscapes by indicating their geographic coordinates, elevation and distance to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. This reveals the strong power relationship between coastal and inland water territories and emphasizes the existing social disconnect to the resource itself. In this reading, the knowledge of where we get our drinking water from and complex socio-political, socio-economic and socio-ecological dynamics set in place, emerge with the awe of its potential absence.

                        BLACKSTREAM
                        <br>
by Moya Sun
<br><br>
The artwork is about the movement among graphite dust, olive oil, and the paper. Each material takes a metaphorical role in the process: dust as the moving elements of the earth ground; oil as the vehicle of the shifting terrain forced by gravity; paper as a frame capturing this movement in the space onto a platform.

<br><br>
I. Birth & Growth (figure 1)
<br><br>
Oil was poured over this artificial mountain of graphite dust, flowing over the paper like a river. By being held on both edges, the paper was set with a slope. The energy of gravity and the tension among materials got expressed through the changing profile of the black stream. The contact between the strokes of materials and the deteriorated blank spaces on the paper is a diagrammatic expression of the covering and the uncovered. As the black stream runs to the bottom edge, another piece of paper, lying on the ground, catch the drops of oil and dust from the first piece of terrain, creating the second piece of the artwork.

<br><br>
II. Settling (figure 2)
<br><br>
With time changing, the sediment got dried out and became more stable as a “landform”; however, the oil transferred from the stroke into the paper texture, creating a new kind of “wetness.” At this point, the paper was no longer only a frame of the territory, but part of the territory. As the floating graphite dust in the air traveled over this new habitat with the wind, they were attached to the wetness and created a darker area. Through this process, the energy and time aspects of the landscape were recorded along the banks of this black stream.
<br><br>

III. Nature & nature (figure 3)
<br><br>
Partials of the black stream in the large initial paper got recaptured and translated onto small pieces of paper by arranging blank papers over the initial piece and printing with manual pressure. Printed small pieces were paired later to show new images with the original material. In other words, those small pieces of terrain were copied and edited into another conversation. Being taken away from their original context, those semi-terrains of the same scale offered new perspectives. Realizing what we have engaged in nature with our eyes, hands, and brains is just parts of Nature, the question of “is nature natural?” has become my adventure scheme for designing and artmaking in these practices.

                        MAUMEE RIVER INDEX
                        <br>
by Nate Wooten and Steve Taylor
<br><br>
The Maumee River Index is a 4-Dimensional animation that overlays publicly available USGS and EPA water quality data into a continuous cinematic aerial overview of a river and its surrounding landscape. The river is further expressed through sonification of data dimensions and landscape context interactions to create a choreographed visual and sound score.
<br><br>
The Maumee River is the largest watershed feeding the Great Lakes, one of the planet’s largest sources of available fresh water. The river’s 6,354 square-mile watershed collects runoff, sediment, and nutrients from Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio and conveys it into Lake Erie’s Western Basin. Excluding the Detroit River, the Maumee provides about half of all tributary volume entering the lake. Prior to the 1850s, the Maumee flowed through one of the largest inland swamps in North America, a glacial remnant, the Black Swamp. The swamp was deforested, drained, and converted to agriculture, which now comprises about 70% of the landcover in the watershed. Symptomatic of many of the rivers that feed Lake Erie, the drastic ecological transformation of the Maumee’s adjacent lands from forested wetland to fertilized monoculture now threatens the health of Lake Erie. Rather than filtering the water of the lake, the Maumee is now its largest polluter dumping raw sewage, excess topsoil, and nitrogren and phosphorus from fertilizer and pesticides into a shallow lake whose waters are further warming due to increased climatic warming. Beginning in the mid-1990s, and steadily worsening since 2011, massive algal blooms have begun to cripple lake Erie each summer, turning the water into a slimy bright green, killing other aquatic organisms, and compromising drinking water intakes for waterfront cities like Toledo. The future of Lake Erie depends on improving regulations and land management practices in watersheds like the Maumee.

                        AFTER THE FLOOD
                        <br>
The Incredible Lost Story of How the Army Corps Redefined Flood Control Infrastructure
<br><br>
by Matthew Seibert and Kristi Cheramie
<br><br>
In 1848, almost fifty years after Thomas Jefferson formalized the Army Corps of Engineers within the U.S. War Department, Congress passed the first Swamp Lands Act. This legislation would seed the Flood Control Acts and trigger a century of geomorphologic imperialism by exposing vast tracts of private land to seizure in service of flood control infrastructure. Over decades of tempering environmental forces across one-third of the United States, the Corps unwittingly assumed position as the most powerful landscape designer in US history. This period of escalation gave rise to some of the country’s most spectacular constructions, configuring spaces and materials at a scale and speed only achievable with federal support for what was essentially an environmental arms race with the Mississippi River.
<br><br>
The Corps’ consistent public message bred broad acceptance of this new attitude towards control of the American landscape. But internally circulated documents found in the archives reveal an institution divided over how best to manage floods and the national anxieties that accompany them. Highly charged and incomplete, these documents create historical footholds within the tacit history of a place, spinning off radically different spatial possibilities.
<br><br>
The documents presented here, both made and found, offer a parafictional window into the history of landscape control. The aim of this collection is to revisit lost worlds and to recover a broader and more inclusive definition of infrastructure. Positioned at the slippage between documented truths, unfinished business and mythic tales, these works dissolve obvious markers of past and present, fact and fiction, and expose our quixotic desire for permanence in the face of constant change. Taken collectively, these documents raise questions about the malleability of history; about the capacity of flood control infrastructure to ever truly secure; about the ability of an institutional archive to carry the conflicting histories, memories and experiences that are inevitably changed as we seek to control natural systems.
