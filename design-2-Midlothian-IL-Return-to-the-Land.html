            This 250-acre neighborhood design is part of a research project that investigates how to
            retrofit cities and
            neighborhoods through green infrastructure to address urban flooding. The research explores
            regional geological
            history and how the native sub-soils that have been paved-over are an important part of better
            stormwater design
            across the region. Rarely is the pre-urban geological landscape and its extant soils considered
            a design “input”
            in green stormwater infrastructure planning in the region. Through an investigation of native
            sub-soils--and their
            range of infiltration potentials--we created a series of design interventions to absorb, hold,
            sponge, and filter
            the largest rain events--through the land itself.
            <br><br>
            Working with the Village of Midlothian, a tireless community who are extremely motivated to
            solve recurring urban
            flooding, the team of landscape architects, geologists, and civil and environmental engineers
            developed a
            neighborhood-scale rainwater design project as an example of urban wet-resilience.
