      <p>
        Water Lab, located in Chicago, Illinois, sits on the unceded lands of the Council of Three Fires, the Odawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi Nations, as well as the tribes of the Miami, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac, Fox, Kickapoo, and Illinois Nations. Controlled occupation of these lands through land cessions and forced removal of these people occurred through the Treaty of Greenville (1795), the Treaty of St. Louis (1816), and the Indian Removal Act (1830). The histories of Indigenous peoples and communities throughout the Chicago region must be acknowledged in the work of Water Lab. We must honor and celebrate Indigenous traditions and care for the land and the waters of the region. And we must contribute the work of restoring relationships among land, water, people, and all living species and entities of the region for remaining Indigenous communities and for all people who live here. 
        <br><br>
        Water Lab is supported by the University of Illinois located in Urbana-Champaign which were the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Piankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Chickasaw Nations. As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois also acknowledges its responsibility to acknowledge the peoples of these lands and to address the histories of dispossession that have allowed for the growth of this institution for the past 150 years.
