            <span class="s-highlight">Water Lab</span>
            is a design research lab working on urban flooding and climate adaptation. We focus on the ground surface
            conditions of cities, identifying ways to transform paved and compacted ground for human and ecological
            health, aesthetics, and resilience.
            <br><br><br>
            <i> DESIGN THAT ADDRESSES ROOT CAUSES:</i>
            <br><br>
            There are multiple intertwined and underlying causes of flooding and stormwater-related issues. These
            include: the slow development of adequate community and nature-minded infrastructure, a legacy of urban
            spatial fragmentation and high imperviousness, systemic injustice in land-use and infrastructure planning,
            and increasing storm intensity and climate disturbance.

            <br><br>
            Water Lab uses critical design thinking to examine and document these issues and generates research and
            transformational design tools to support new forms of adaptation and systemic disruption, knowledge sharing,
            and pathways for collaborative design. A defining area of Water Lab’s research has been on the medium of the
            urban ground surface in public space design, urban adaptation, and climate resilience.
            <br><br><br>
            <i> DESIGN JUSTICE and COMMUNITY EXPERTISE:</i>
            <br><br>
            Water Lab’s goal is to support urban communities who have been most affected by the convergence of systemic
            injustices and for whom design, planning, investment, and outcomes are most critical.
            <br><br>
            Community organizations and residents are experts about the places they live and concerns must be localled
            defined. By learning about potential areas for design change, Water Lab can share research and design tools
            to support community-based decision-making about how to transform places and spaces in neighborhoods.
            <br><br><br>
            <i> DESIGN RESEARCH COLLABORATION and EDUCATION:</i>
            <br><br>
            Water Lab works with multi-disciplinary researchers from science and engineering, artists, and public
            organizations, often coordinated with curriculum and educational programming on urban and regional water
            design. We create frameworks for regenerating functional and aesthetic relationships among geology, soils,
            water, climate, urbanization patterns, and human perception and well-being.
            <br><br>
            Through its affiliations with Illinois’ Department of Landscape Architecture, the College of Fine & Applied
            Arts, Illinois’ Prairie Research Institute, Illinois Extension, and external professional partners, Water
            Lab operates in a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and inclusive way, fulfilling the University’s mission
            of design advocacy and support in the public interest.
            <br><br><br>
            <b> Water Lab is based in Chicago</b> and currently focuses on water issues in the Chicago-Calumet region.
            Our contribution to the protection of the Great Lakes is also central to our purpose. Across the Great
            Lakes, there is a lot of work to do to clean-up and restore our natural systems as decades of environmental
            degradation and injustice continue to harm our water, soil, and air and the health of people living in our
            communities. Climate migration is expected to bring more people to the region. Understanding our land,
            water, and social histories, coupled with today’s rust-belt conditions, shifting populations, and changing
            economies, all within the largest freshwater source of North America, creates a critical design territory
            for water.
