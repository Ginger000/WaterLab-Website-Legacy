                    <h2>Chicago Geologic Substrata Infiltration</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      Because rainwater is a significant input into the combined system, why not keep rainwater out of it? Are there places we can infiltrate water and keep it in the Lake Michigan watershed? 
                      <br><br>
                      This excellent question led us to explore the potential to infiltrate water in Chicago, right in neighborhoods, right in industrial areas, and in streets that run through both. In looking back at the hydrologic history and the glacial soils, we located a series of glacial deposits at the surface and subsurface--composed of sands and gravels--capable of infiltrating water, and potentially creating recharge zones for Lake Michigan. Thus, the glaciated landscape of Chicago actually contains one of the keys to unlocking the system. 
                      <br><br>
                      The U.S. Geologic Survey of 1902 mapped dune sand and sand & gravel soil types that exist in the coastal area, a roughly 5-10 miles width of the shoreline. These soils can infiltrate, wash, and return rainwaters underground and to the Lake. By creating opportunities for rainwater that is ponding at the surface to sink into lower soil layers, we can restore dried out soils and vegetation and create a healthier local microclimate by encouraging hydric and thermal exchange through the ground surface. Knowledge of soil variability across the City provides a rich and productive way to re-imagine and re-structure the city by managing water in a more specific yet comprehensive manner. 
                      <br><br>
                      The image on the left is of sand, dune sand, and gravelly soils (cut-out from the USGS 1902 survey). The image at right combines a depiction of these same soil areas from a 2009 USGS map with other landscape networks as part of the Millennium Reserve and the glacial remnants of the Indiana coast area to the east. 
                      <br><br>
                      To respond to water issues across the city, this research suggests that there is a network of urban lands where rainwater can be captured and conveyed through passive infiltration features - that together, will help to resolve the region's long term relationship with stormwater. 
                      <br><br>
                      Part of this strategy will include creating a new interface between urban surface and geologic substrata permeability and transport, increasing the performance potential of both layers.
