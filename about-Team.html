                <b>Mary Pat McGuire</b> , Water Lab’s Director, is an Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture at
                the University of
                Illinois - Urbana Champaign and a Licensed Landscape Architect.

                Mary Pat’s passion is water. She thinks about landscapes through water--where it lives and how it
                moves and interacts with the land. She lived on and off a sailboat for several years, exploring the
                margins of coasts, observing how water interacts along shorelines and fell in love with the changing
                state of this element that defines our planet.

                  <p>
                    After ten years of professional practice on
                    landscape design projects and large-scale stormwater planning, Mary Pat started teaching students
                    how to
                    redesign and retrofit cities against flooding and run-off. She created and directs Water Lab to
                    develop
                    better design research for water in urban environments, and to work alongside communities to create
                    better places to live with water.
                    <br><br>
                    Mary Pat’s research has been supported by Wright-Ingraham Institute, University of Illinois
                    Research Board, IL/IN Sea Grant (NOAA), US-EPA, and the Brent & Jean Wadsworth Endowment. She has
                    twice served as Research Fellow with the Landscape Architecture Foundation, and was an inaugural
                    Design Research Fellow in the College of Fine & Applied Arts (FAA) at the University of Illinois.
                    McGuire has a BA in International Political Theory from William & Mary, a Master in Landscape
                    Architecture from the University of Virginia, and a Certificate in Leadership in Sustainability
                    Management from the University of Chicago. She previously practiced for Peter Walker & Partners
                    (Berkeley, CA) and Conservation Design Forum (Chicago).
