                    <p><span class="highlight"> <strong>Stormwater needs a design revolution.</strong></span> Urban flooding, which is all too common across Chicago and southern Cook County, has been intensifying through climate change. We need a new approach to living with water and a citywide transition through ecological design. However, we believe this design revolution will be a community-based effort in collaboration with and supported by researchers, designers, and municipal leaders. 
                      <br><br>
                      Water Lab's<span class="highlight"> <strong> Design ColLABorative</strong></span> aims to facilitate that effort, by working directly with community organizations to think through the various problems associated with flooding - and by helping to apply design research to identify alternatives and possibilities.
                      <br><br>
                      Water Lab’s <span class="highlight"> <strong> Depave Chicago project</strong></span> specifically targets the redesign of impervious and compacted surfaces around the city. With upwards of 30-50% of cities paved and compacted, we work to reverse and transform this condition in order to create more healthful living systems and surfaces in communities.
